This is a simple working version of the Academy Addon example for Odoo. It a start for beginners.

To show the academy page just go into website app of odoo, and go to url yoursite/academy/

This addon includes a view.xml files, in order to be able to add datas on backend side of odoo, into academy top menu.
The demo.xml file contains datas : the courses and teachers relation are not stated, so you can affect a teacher to a course into the backend menu.

Next step:
>> There is 2 open questions in templates.xml file. Thanks for providing a solution.
>> Third question is : how to write into the demo.xml file the data about the relations Courses-Teachers (One2many and many2one). -> SOLVED in commit NÂ°4
